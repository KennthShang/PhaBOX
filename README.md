  🎉 Generalize for all kinds of viruses with faster speed! But we will call it PhaBOX2, not VirBOX, for a better inheritance ：) 

  🎉 Provide a more comprehensive taxonomy classification (latest ICTV 2024) and complete taxonomy lineage

  🎉 Provide a genus-level clustering for potential new genera (genus-level vOTU)!

  🎉 Provide a protein annotation function!

  🎉 Provide a contamination and prophage detection module!

  🎉 Allowing to predict host using your bacterial MAGs
